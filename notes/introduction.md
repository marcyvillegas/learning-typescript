# TYPESCRIPT TYPES (see index.ts)

## Any
- from its word "any"
- any data type
- can be useful if you don't know the data type of a parameter in a function

## Array
- In JS, each element of an array can have different types.
- Typescript can declare the type of each element
- If an array is empty, it will have a data type of any which we must avoid.

## Tuple
- Fixed length array where each length has a specific type.
- Restrict this only into 2 values. Anything more than that will make your code hard to understand

## Enums
- Used similar to the *const* data type.
